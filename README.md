## Lab 4: Real-Time Data Streaming with Amazon Kinesis and CloudWatch
- I created a real-time data streaming pipeline in this lab using Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and CloudWatch. I configured a Kinesis data stream to receive sales data, developed a Lambda function to process incoming records, and used CloudWatch Logs Insights to monitor and analyze the data stream. 

## Lab 5: Load Balancer Configuration and Traffic Distribution

- In this lab, I configured a load balancer using Nginx on an EC2 instance to manage traffic distribution among multiple web servers. The lab also involved analyzing traffic using packet capture and creating a backup instance using an AMI.
